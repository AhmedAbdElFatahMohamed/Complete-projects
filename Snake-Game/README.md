# Snake Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game consists of a snake that moves around the screen and tries to eat food items while avoiding walls and its own tail.

## Code Files
The project contains the following four code files:

- food.py: This file contains the Food class that defines the behavior of the food items that the snake can eat.

- main.py: This file is the main driver file that runs the Snake game. It creates the game screen, initializes the snake and food objects, and handles the game logic.

- score.py: This file contains the ScoreBoard class that keeps track of the player's score and displays it on the game screen.

- snake.py: This file contains the Snake class that defines the behavior of the snake object.

## Dependencies
The Snake game requires the turtle module that is included in Python's standard library. No additional packages need to be installed.

## How to Run
To run the game, execute the main.py file using Python. The game screen will appear, and the player can start playing by using the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen. The objective is to eat as many food items as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail. The player's score is displayed on the top of the screen, and the game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own tail.

Enjoy playing the Snake game!
